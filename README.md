## Introduction

Time series prediction involves using historical data to forecast future values in a sequence. In this project, the historical data consists of daily Bitcoin prices, and the goal is to predict future prices based on past trends. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is also performed to gain insights into the dataset.

## Features

- Uses a Bitcoin dataset for time series prediction.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
- Employs a machine learning model for predicting future Bitcoin prices.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to perform EDA and time series prediction.
    ```bash
    python time_series_prediction.py
    ```

2. **Choose Prediction Parameters**:
    - The script will prompt you to input parameters such as the number of days to predict.
    
3. **Receive Predictions**:
    - The system will display the predicted future values of Bitcoin prices based on the input parameters.

## Data

- The Bitcoin dataset contains historical daily prices of Bitcoin, including open, close, high, low, and volume values.
- The data is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to train the prediction model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- EDA is performed on the Bitcoin dataset to understand its structure and identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
- Visualizations such as line plots and histograms may be used to explore the data and its distribution.

## Prediction Model

- A machine learning model, such as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network or an autoregressive model, may be used for predicting future Bitcoin prices.
- The model is trained on historical data and then used to predict future values.

## Code Explanation

- **time_series_prediction.py**:
    - The script for loading the Bitcoin dataset, performing EDA, and running the time series prediction model.
    - Loads the data and visualizes it for EDA.
    - Trains the prediction model on historical data.
    - Uses the model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
